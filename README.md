# Fast_Hyper-USS

This repository contains the code for the speed-optimized versions of the Hyper-USS algorithm, which answers subset queries over multi-attribute data streams. 

## Optimized Version

This repository contains the speed-optimized versions of the Hyper-USS algorithm, which has been improved for better performance. The optimizations focus on speed enhancements to make the algorithm more efficient in processing data streams.

We conduct extensive experiments to compare Hyper-USS and its speed-optimized versions with the SOTA sketch solutions on subset queries over multi-attribute data streams, aiming to answer the following questions:
**Q1**: How does the insertion throughput of our methods compare with USS and CocoSketch when multiple statistical attributes are involved?

**Q2**: How does the accuracy of our methods compare with USS and CocoSketch when multiple statistical attributes are involved?

**Q3**: How is the performance of our methods affected by different parameter settings?

**Q4**: How does our algorithm perform when subset query support is extended to arbitrary predicate combinations, as filtering conditions compared with Omnisketch?

You can find the optimized code in this repository: [Fast_Hyper-USS](https://github.com/moxiaoshao/Fast_Hyper-USS/blob/master/CPU2.0).
