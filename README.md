# Fast_Hyper-USS

This repository contains the code for the speed-optimized versions of the Hyper-USS algorithm, which answers subset queries over multi-attribute data streams. 

## Optimized Version

This repository contains the speed-optimized versions of the Hyper-USS algorithm, which has been improved for better performance. The optimizations focus on speed enhancements to make the algorithm more efficient in processing data streams.

You can find the optimized code in this repository: [Fast_Hyper-USS](https://github.com/moxiaoshao/Fast_Hyper-USS/blob/master/CPU2.0).
